<p><b>Co-Constructing Novel Perspectives.</b> Grow a different tree each time you interact, based on rhythms of the music, when you press the button, and other built-in random variables. The trees model the actor-audience roles that people take up as they engage in creative work. The developing network of action is dynamic, influenced by rhythms of perspective exchange between multiple projects. Finally, when two networks  collide, as in role exchange, novel action paths can emerge.</p> 
<p><b>Inspiration.</b> I wanted to capture the dynamic nature of creative work, and the way that participating in multiple creative projects can increase perspective-taking and role exchange, and the opportunities of perspective-exchange in collaborations.</p>
<p><b>Process:</b> My process involved reasearch into potential models to represent interaction as well as the complexity, chance, and structure involved in creative work. While the collision and change of elements affords a model of change and interaction, the L-systems were able to capture the network of roles that people co-construct.</p> 
<p><b>Future Work:</b> I am interested in working with more organic forms of fractal trees, particularly those that are constructed from text-based patterns. I am also working on modeling a collision between the two tree branches. Finally, I would like to add a physical computing component or gestural component to the piece. </p>
